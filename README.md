## My process
I have decided to use reactjs to build this card component, it has been a bit harder than expected. I have decided to brake up each part into div's, the body, outer box div, white box div to hold qr and labels, qr div, and word div. 

Afterwards, css, used colors to see where each component is, used flex on the body so that I can get the card component to be centered. 
next the .box, the main outer box, I have created the basic shape, and added a shadow, 
the white box, which is in charge of holding in the qr and the labels. 

looking back, i think i may have added too many divs, but I also added a div for the wording that would make it easier to text align, 

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned
using the grid and flexbox much better, I was unable to get the virtially centered using reactjs. 
When researching online on how to use css much more, probably learning everything that i was not looking for loll. 
Also I believe that I may have gotten better at looking for the solutions to my problems. 


### Continued development
I would like to refine my knoledge of how to be able to  produce what is in my mind into code. I would also like to be able to know how to word my problems, especially the errors. I believe that learning to know how to read the error messages is a very important skill to have.
